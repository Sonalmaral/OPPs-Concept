        "Thory Question:\n",
        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)+\n",
        ">> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP+\n",
        ">> A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP+\n",
        ">> An object is a real-world instance of a class. It is the actual entity created based on the class blueprint, and it holds data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation+\n",
        ">> Abstraction: Hide complexity and show only the essential features\n",
        "\n",
        ">>  Encapsulation: Hide data and protect it from being directly accessed or modified.\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python+\n",
        ">> Dunder methods (short for \"Double UNDERscore\" methods) are special built-in methods in Python that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
        ">> Inheritance is a feature in OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The class that is inherited from is called the Parent Class (or Base Class).\n",
        "\n",
        "The class that inherits is called the Child Class (or Derived Class)\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP+\n",
        ">> Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP, polymorphism allows the same method or function to behave differently depending on the object it is acting on. It's one of the core principles that makes OOP flexible and powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python+\n",
        ">> Encapsulation is the OOP concept of wrapping data and methods into a single unit (a class), and restricting direct access to some parts of an object. It's like protecting the internal state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python+\n",
        ">> A constructor is a special method that automatically runs when you create (instantiate) an object from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python+\n",
        ">> A class method is a method that:\n",
        "\n",
        "Belongs to the class itself, not the instance\n",
        "\n",
        "Has access to the class state (but not instance state)\n",
        "\n",
        "Takes cls as its first parameter (instead of self)\n",
        "\n",
        "Is marked with the @classmethod decorator\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python+\n",
        ">> Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (type, number, or both) in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP+\n",
        ">> Method overriding means redefining a method in a child class that is already defined in its parent class — with the same name and same parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python+\n",
        ">> The @property decorator is used to turn a method into a “read-only” attribute — so you can access it like a variable, but it still runs code behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP+\n",
        ">> Polymorphism literally means “many forms.”\n",
        "In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of a common parent class, but still behave differently based on their class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python+\n",
        ">> An abstract class is like a template or blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "It:\n",
        "\n",
        "Cannot be instantiated directly (you can't create objects of it)\n",
        "\n",
        "Can contain abstract methods (methods that have no body)\n",
        "\n",
        "Is used to enforce a structure in the child classes\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP+\n",
        ">> reusability,encapsulation, polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable+\n",
        ">> Class variable belonging to class variable and instance variable is individual object (instance)\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python+\n",
        ">> Multiple inheritance means that a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, a child class can access methods and attributes from multiple parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        ">> __str__()\tHuman-readable (nice, clean output)\tUsers / Print output\n",
        "__repr__()\tDeveloper-readable (debugging purpose)\tDevelopers / Debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python+\n",
        ">> super() is a built-in function that gives you access to methods from a parent (super) class — without naming it explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python+\n",
        ">> __del__() is a special method (a.k.a. dunder method) called when an object is about to be destroyed — typically when there are no more references to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s like a destructor in other languages (like C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python+\n",
        ">>  @staticmethod: Class only (not instance or class itself)\t@classmethod:Class (not instance)\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance+\n",
        ">> Polymorphism = \"many forms\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows different classes to be used through a common interface, even if they behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism often works through inheritance and method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP+\n",
        ">> Method chaining is a technique where you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        ">> The __call__() method is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n"
